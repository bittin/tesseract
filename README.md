# Tesseract

Measure your speed cubing in the fourth dimension.

### Current state

We're still very early in the life of this app, so features are thin on the ground. Currently we have the bare basics:

- Generate scrambles
- Time your solves

### Future features

In order of priority:

- Logging of past solves, with AO5 and AO12 tracking
- Organise your solving into sessions
- Support for WCA puzzles other than 3x3
- UI enhancements (e.g. scramble visualisation)

### Install

Clone this repo and run these commands in its root:

```
just build-release
just install
```
